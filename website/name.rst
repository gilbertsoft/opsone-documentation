Name
====

The website name is defined once when you create the website initially.
All parts configured within the system are tied to this name so it
**cannot be modified afterwards**.

Among others, the name is used to configure:

* system user and group
* database name and username (applies only when a database is configured)
* webserver vhost name
* configuration files
* type related cronjobs
* unix sockets, for example used between nginx and PHP
